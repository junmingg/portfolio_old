    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a Final Year Economics Student with a Second Major in Data Science &amp; Analytics from Singapore Management University.</p>
      <p>My main interests are in Data Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and little bit of Web Development.</p>
      <p>I enjoy learning new things and solving puzzles which is why I enjoy doing analytics and programming as they provide me with the challenges that I seek.</p>
      <p>I enjoy driving insights from data and the difficulties that come with programming.</p>
      <p>In the summer of 2021, I taught myself how to do Web Development.</p>

      <p>Currently, I am seeking an internship from November to May in Data Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, but I am open to Web Development roles as well.</p>
      <p>As of the up coming semester next year (Jan 2022 to Apr 2022), I will be left with 2 modules before I can graduate. Thus, I will be able to work 4 days a week.</p>
